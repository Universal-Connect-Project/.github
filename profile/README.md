## Project Structure

The Universal Connect Project consists of a number of repositories. The following is a list of the repositories, and 
their purpose.

### Repositories

- [UCW App](https://github.com/Universal-Connect-Project/ucw-app) - This is the main codebase that anyone wanting to 
    implement the Universal Connect Widget will need. Please see the [UCW App README](https://github.com/Universal-Connect-Project/ucw-app/blob/main/README.md) for more information. 
- [Widget Component](https://github.com/Universal-Connect-Project/universal-connect-widget-new) - This is the Widget React Component. This is the core of the Universal Connect Widget UI, and 
is packaged as an NPM package. It does not need to be implemented directly, rather the NPM package is used by the 
UCW App project.
